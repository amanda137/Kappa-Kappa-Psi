		events leading up to the start of the process. 
		I do not mean it to be this way but for some reason I can not remember, however, 
		one thing I do remember was meet the brothers. I remember not knowing what to wear 
		to make sure I came fancily dressed. I remember going to the UC, and then I believe 
		walking over with Luke afterwards because I did not want to walk in alone. Once there 
		I remember walking around and talking to everyone, and eventually got stuck having my 
		picture getting taken. To be honest it was not that bad in the end because it started 
		my memorable moments with the other brothers and at the the time potential MC's. Now I 
		can something that I could rememeber. A memory I can share. At the end of the night we 
		were given audition pieces for our prospective instrument, guard, or baton, if we chose 
		to continue on the path. I stressed over the marimba piece. I really wanted to make sure 
		I played it as best as I could since I've never played the marimba before. To my somewhat 
		relief, Kelly came to me and said that I could play 8-8-16 and Accent Tap (percussion pieces 
		drumline learned during band camp). I practiced a decent amount because I really wanted to 
		succeed in my audition. I did not know what I was being judged upon. At my audition I messed 
		up and I was so upset with myself. Luckily, for some reason, I was accepted to go to interview night.</font></p>

	    <br>
	    <p style="padding-right: 30px; padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;"><font size="4"> Interview night, where to start. Let's start at the beginning and talk about how much I 
	    remember. We were in Room A. After sometime I startd to play the piano with Shannon, Steph, 
	    and I think Kailee and Luke. I remember Raven went into a side room and people were getting 
	    called out one by one but were not coming back. To me in did not worry me that much I believe. 
	    Maybe it did, but I could not remember. When ben came to get me I was slightly upset because I 
	    did not get to finish playing what I was playing on the piano. I remember Vanessa, and I think 
	    Emma Emma were outside Room A waiting for me. We walked to a UC classroom, possibly UC 106, or 
	    maybe UC 110. Either way it was on the right side of the hallway. At the door Ben did a secret 
	    knock and that's when I started to feel alittle off. It scared me because I did not know what 
	    to expect. The secret knock came from the other side of the door and it opened. I remember being 
	    told to sit and to be honest I really did not see the chair in the middle of the room. I sat down 
	    and Bee ask if they could ask me some questions, so I said yes. If my memory serves me correct, 
	    Jacob and Bee both asked me a question. I was expecting certain questions so I made sure to think 
	    of them before hand so I would not be caught off guard, but I still was. I forgot to say everything 
	    I previously thought of.  Afterwards Ben went to escort me out and asked for my hand. I was so 
	    confused so I spoke and out some people made a noise. I knew then that the brothers slightly broke 
	    character, which instead of making me feel better, I felt worse. I did take his hand outside of the 
	    room though because I did not want him to feel bad. It was weird. I was brought to UC 112 or UC114 and 
	    met my other comrades who already went through the interview. When Ben left I went crazy. I climbed on 
	    tables and had some minor panic attacks, and analyzed the sugar out of everything. Who went first, who 
	    went next, etc.. Who asked who questions, what was the order. What questions were asked, why. What did 
	    the room look like, how were you gathered from Room A and how were you brought to the waiting room. I 
	    went crazy. Maeve was there for me though and I stayed with her. We wrote everyones name on the boards 
	    and crossed off when they came in so we knew who was left. I remember some people came in crying and 
	    some people had anxiety attacks, major and minor. To calm us down we watched Moana and the Red Soxs 
	    baseball game, courtesy of Luke and Shannon. When everyone went through the interview, we were brought 
	    back to the UC room and the chapter sung the hymn. I think I started laughing, but not because it was funny, 
	    but because we were all shaken up and that's how I was cooping. Afterwards some of us went to JP's and we 
	    talked to this really nice waitress Sky (The one with different makeup). I can't remember what happened 
	    after we left, but I think we all went back to our rooms. </font></p>

	    It drove me a bit crazy. Just ask Meave. Before and after I went on my private interview with Vanessa 
	    at Linda's, I was in contact with Maeve. And I kept telling her the people we met with miss mean 
	    something. Some of us, me included are not making it any further in the process. I worried and worried 
	    and worried because I really really wanted to continue with the process. I don't remember who said it, 
	    but at one point someone said guys the people we met with our probably our bigs. And with that I 
	    continued thinking the worst so I wouldn't feel as upset if I did not make it (but that never works 
	    anyways. It's jus nice to think that). I met with Vanessa and she explained some things to me and from 
	    there the process continued.<right><img src="First Degree the MC's.jpg" align= "right" width="313.375" height="417.875" hspace="20"></right> </font></p>
