		    I think we waited in the band room for this event. I remember staying close to my guard buddies 
		    after a while because the brothers were taking very long to come and get us. There was a divide 
		    between us I believe. We were not that close yet as a group. To calm me down, I did the gaurd 
		    warm-up stretches with Maeve, and I think Raven and Shannon. I don't think it actually worked to 
		    calm me down though. The one thing that the formal event took from me was my sense of control in 
		    a situation. I think the process was maybe meant to do that because it's supposed to teach us. 
		    Even if that wasn't a point of the process, we all developed as people in general and together. 
		    We went through things that nobody else saw. We helped each other, and because of that we are closer 
		    than ever before. After Ben got us from the Band Room, (unless it was Room A), we walked through the 
		    school to the SC and then out to the Schine. Because we were in shortest to tallest height order I was 
		    directly behind Maeve. She held my hand to make sure I felt more secure and less anxious. It helped 
		    knowing that someone was there for me. At the Schine we were told that we did not have to put blindfolds 
		    on, but it was suggested we do. I think everyone did because no one wanted to be the person who didn't 
		    and these were our friends. I think we all knew that they went through this themselves so everything will
		    be okay. I believe Emma Emma was there, unless it was Vanessa, and she helped me put my blindfold on. We 
		    went in. I kinda cheated with being blindfolded. I was able to see the ground so I looked down the whole 
		    time. Things were said. I would love to say I remember but it happened so long ago that my memory is not 
		    there. Afterwards the brothers came to us and Vanessa put a pin on me. She was my big! I was definitely, 
		    extremely excited, even if I didn't show it. I was very very lucky to have Vanessa and Emma Emma. We all 
		    took pictures and then went out to eat. Side Note: Chris likes jalapenos and was quite hungry that night. 
		    I had a good night overall. It was definitely not as bad as I thought it would be, and I definitely did not 
		    like how everything went; but I got through it all and now I have learned and grown.</font></p>

		    Nobody(MC's) is prepared for any ritual, and Second was no different. Things were the same as the first event. 
		    We were in either the Band room or Room A waiting. I think Second was the day Raven came bursting out in the 
		    room about her fish bowl room. Sam recorded it and provided the video in our class groupchat which we called 
		    Crying Emoji. I played on the piano to calm me down, and the others watched disney songs on Youtube.  Then Ben 
		    came to get us. This time I think Vanessa came with him and Chris. We went in height order again so I was 
		    behind Maeve, which was really good because she is my buddy. We went to the Schine again, but they must have 
		    ran out of newspaper, because they covered half the windows with paper towels (hahah). Seeing that made me feel 
		    slightly less stressed. Blindfold time, I thought I was ready. Second screwed me big time. I was not ready. I 
		    remember Maeve being taken from me so I grabbed Danielles hand (I'm lucky she allowed it) annd Maeve was led 
		    around the star. Arguing happened at one point and I didn't say again. I never do even when I think or know I 
		    should. After everything I was shaken up, just like everyone else. Then Ben came out, took our blindfolds, and 
		    threw them against the wall. It was then that I knew he was p'd off at us and I did not know why. He told us 
		    why he was, but I don't remember much. I was too shaken to pay extremely close attention. Plus only two things 
		    stood out the most to me. One even more than the other. When Ben was done he left and we went outside. We knew 
		    we needed to stay together, so most of us did. I remember standing outside talking to Sam and Maeve had to get 
		    me because the brothers were starting to leave. I felt very hurt and upset and because my emotions and thoughts 
		    were everywhere I was not that stable. We went to an SC classroom. I think 101 or something like that. We sat 
		    and talked about what happened and about  our projects. At one point Bee and Kelly walked by. At another point 
		    Maeve was called out of the room to speak to Bee. At the end some of us went to Lindas and others broke off to 
		    Toussiant, and others stayed together somewhere else. Before I went to Lindas I called my mom and told her 
		    something Ben said and how it made me feel. I remember crying because everything took hold of me and I just broke. 
		    The same happened after Lindas. I thought we couldn't talk to our bigs so I texted Laura and I believe she was 
		    the one who contacted Vanessa, who called me. We talked and I felt much better than before afterwards; and I was 
		    able to enjoy the movies Luke, Meghan, Julianne, Kailee, and Sarah Batho were watching. Second messed with us all 
		    big time, but I think we each learned something about ourselves. I think we all change in a good way and our 
		    friendships became just alittle closer. Crying Emoji meant more than anything in those moments.</right></font></p>

		    Before the last formal event, was one of the most specialist moments I've had, and I really hope that I never 
		    forget that night. We (MC's) practiced the hymn together and it sounded beautiful. That moment felt so pure and 
		    real after everything we've gone through together during the process and every crappy moment we've had. We 
		    offically became closer than and I hope things do not change. Being a big class was hard but we made it with a 
		    few bruises and cuts that healed with time. I love these guys and even though we are far apart in many ways, I 
		    know I can always count on them to be there for me and they can always count on me to be there for them. We knew 
		    the brothers were going to take awhile because they always did, so we sung the riff offs to pitch perfect, danced, 
		    listened to Amanda rap the fast part is Rap God, and most importantly we stood in a circle and said something to 
		    the group about the process. I asked if I could give everyone a hug, so that's what I did. We were gathered by Ben 
		    for what was going to be one last time. (I'd say we did not know that but everyone guessed that we'd cross that 
		    night anyways.) Instead of going through his usual path to the Schine, Ben brought us through the outisde of the 
		    UC into the SC, and then brought us to the Schine. We did blindfolds again and went in. So much was said that I 
		    lost track, however, I do remember Keith spoke to us. At the end Vanessa came over and switched my MC pin to the 
		    pin Brothers wore. We crossed!! All of our hardwork paid off! Vanessa gave me letters, which I love by the way. 
		    And we took more photos. I wish Emma Emma was there, but she had twirling so she couldn't be. That's okay because 
		    we took a photo with a photo of her. I had such a great night that I climb from seat to seat and ran around like a 
		    crazy person. The one thing that still blows me mind though is that we are brothers. That means that we can do 
		    almost everything the other brothers can do. It's mindblowing to me. At the very end, before a secret something, we 
		    sung the hymn together. Alumni, present, and new brothers. It sounded really really pretty, and in that moment I 
		    knew even if home life is hard sometimes, I would always have family.  </font></p>
